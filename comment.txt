SQL Comments
Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.

Note: Comments are not supported in Microsoft Access databases!

Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with --.

Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).
